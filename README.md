## Instructions

Use the directional array keys (up, down, left, right) to move the player. The player can only move one square per direction key hit. The goal of the game is to have the player reach the water (other side) without hitting any of the enemies or bugs. If the player hits an enemey, then the player is reset back to the start position. A collision occurs when the player comes into contact with an enemy on any side. The score is deducted by 50 points everytime the player and an enemy collide. Futher, 75 points is rewarded every time the player makes it across to the water. Game is won when the score either reaches or surpasses 300 points. 

Once the score either reaches or surpasses 300 points, a win modal populates. This resets the score and the user can decide to play again by simply closing the win modal.
